//        Blocks - a block is a group of one or more statements that's enclosed in braces.

//        creating identifiers
//              -an identifier is a word that you make up to refer to a java programming element by name(classes, methods,variable,parameters)
//        rules - case-sensitive, can use either case, no space but underscore,begins with letter, not the same as java keyword,

        //comments //single-line, /* multi-line comment */

//        intro to OOP
//        classes

//        static methods - if you declare a method of a class as static , you can call the method without first creating an object
//        because static methods are called from classes , not from objects (they belong to the class not a specific object)

//        creating an object from a class
//        ClassName identifier = new ClassName();

//        importing java API classes
//        syntax (import package)
//        rules - import at the top, any amount, import all classes using *,
